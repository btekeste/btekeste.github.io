## Instructions
The Memory Game is the classic card game where you have to match cards with the same figure. This game was implemented with 16 cards, start rating 1 to 3 and a timer to track user performance. The Restart icon allow you to reset the game with reshuffled cards and 3 star rating.
You can easily personalize the game changing the card figures with your favorite icons from [https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) and modify the class deck in the index.html file.
This project was forked from Udacity Front-End program and evaluated by Udacity code reviewers.
